#Loop Program:
#1. Objective: Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
#2. Steps:
#Use a for loop with the range() function to iterate over numbers from 1 to 5.
#Inside the loop, print each number.

# for i in range(5):
#  print(i)

#Function Program:
# 1. Objective: Create functions to calculate the sum and product of two numbers.
# 2. Steps:
# Define two functions: calculate_sum(a, b) and calculate_product(a, b).
# Inside each function, perform the respective mathematical operation (+ for sum, *
#for product).
# Call these functions with two numbers as arguments and print the results.



def sum(x,y):
 return x + y

def product(x,y):
 return x * y

a = 50
b = 30
print(sum(a,b))
print(product(a,b))
